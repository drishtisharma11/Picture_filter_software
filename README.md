Picture Filter Software
This project was developed during my internship, utilizing Python and OpenCV to create a picture filter software. The software allows users to apply various image processing techniques such as:

Image Enhancement: Adjust brightness, contrast, and sharpness to improve the visual quality of images.
Image Transformation: Apply filters like blurring, edge detection, and color transformations (e.g., grayscale, sepia).
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in digital image processing and contributed to optimizing the software for efficiency and a seamless user experience. The final product is user-friendly and demonstrates core concepts in image manipulation.
